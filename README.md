## Hybrid Rocket Analysis Program

For the MATLAB version, navigate to the "HRAP - v1.0.4 -  MATLAB" directory. A Python version is also in progress but not complete yet.

The Hybrid Rocket Analysis Program (HRAP) was developed by Robert Nickel for use by the University of Tennessee Rocket Engineering Team. HRAP is a versatile tool utilizing a thermodynamic equilibrium model for  simulation of self-pressurizing hybrid rocket motors, especially those powered with Nitrous Oxide stored as a saturated liquid-vapor mixture. 

In its current state this program can model an adiabatic oxidizer tank and combustion chamber and an isentropic nozzle, future iterations will account for subsonic flow and flow separation to better model thrust, add an option to export a .eng or .rse engine file for use in OpenRocket or RockSim, and will allow the use of other self-pressurizing oxidizers such as Nytrox. Development is also needed for more configuration files describing burn characteristics of different propellants.
